# 🧯 Emergency Services Accessibility in Pomona, CA 🚑

This project identifies gaps in fire station and hospital accessibility in **Pomona, California** using **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**. By analyzing **population density**, **existing service locations**, and **road networks**, we aimed to support data-driven decisions on where new emergency service facilities should be located.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Identify EMS coverage gaps beyond 15-minute drive-time zones
- Evaluate population and infrastructure impact on accessibility
- Recommend new fire station placement to maximize service equity

## 📍 Area of Interest
Pomona, CA — a dense urban region in Los Angeles County with known traffic congestion, uneven EMS distribution, and underserved neighborhoods.

## 🧰 GIS Tools & Techniques Used
- **Drive-Time Analysis** using ArcGIS Network Analyst
- **Buffer Analysis** to visualize proximity zones
- **Zonal Statistics** for population density overlays
- **Hotspot Mapping** for underserved communities

## 🗺️ Key Maps
- 📏 1.5 Mile Buffer Zones
- 🚗 5, 10, 15-Minute Drive Time Zones
- 👥 Population Overlay with Service Gaps
- 🔵 Recommended Location for New Fire Station
